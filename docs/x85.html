>&#13;          What we wanna have is, as said before, a Digester-like API
          for serizalizing Java objects into XML.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Imagine that we have an object, called <TT
CLASS="function"
>Person</TT
>,
          that would like to represent in XML format. Such class has
          some attributes, <TT
CLASS="function"
>name</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="function"
>age</TT
>.
          In XML, such information could be represented as follows.
          <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;
          &#60;person name="fred" age=23"/&#62;

          </PRE
>
          <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Digester</I
></SPAN
> simplifies the task of
          building a <TT
CLASS="function"
>Person</TT
> object from previous XML.
          <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;          Digester digester = ...;
          digester.push(person);
          digester.addRule("person", new SetPropertiesRule());
          </PRE
>
          Alternatively, to serialize it, we'd like to have an API
          that allows us a way of doing it like this:
          <PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;          Undigester undigester = ...;
          StringBuffer results = new StringBuffer();
          undigester.push(person);
          undigester.addRule(
              new GetNameRule(
                  new String[]{ Person.class.getName() }));

          undigester.addRule(
              new GetPropertyRule(
                  new String[]{ Person.class.getName() },
                  "name"));

          undigester.addRule(
              new GetPropertyRule(
                  new String[]{ Person.class.getName() },
                  "age"));

          results.append(undigester.unparse());
          </PRE
>
          The reason of using the class name as the rule matching
          condition is because, when Digester finds &#60;person&#62; in
          the XML (that is, the rule is matched), the object in the
          stack, of type <TT
CLASS="function"
>Person</TT
>, is filled up with
          the attribute information in such XML. Therefore, the
          inverse process needs to be able to match using any
          criteria. The input information is now a tree of Java
          objects, referred to each others by Java pointers. So a rule
          matches or not depending on the current Java object being
          parsed, so it has to be based on its available
          meta-information, such as the class name.
          There's another issue, though. For parsing, a Digester rule like
          "a/b/c" identifies elements in a tree with grandparent
          <TT
CLASS="function"
>a</TT
> and parent <TT
CLASS="function"
>b</TT
>. It's easy because
          there's nothing special to do to find <TT
CLASS="function"
>b</TT
>
          elements starting from <TT
CLASS="function"
>a</TT
>. However, for
          unparsing, <TT
CLASS="function"
>a</TT
> could have a method of an
          arbitrary name to retrieve <TT
CLASS="function"
>b</TT
>, typically
          <TT
CLASS="function"
>getB()</TT
>, but we cannot make any assumption
          here. When <TT
CLASS="function"
>b</TT
> is not just a single object, but
          several, <TT
CLASS="function"
>getBs()</TT
> could return an array, a
          Collection, Iterator, etc. That's why we need to include
          more information to define rules.

>3.1.2. Undigester's stack</H3
><P
>&#13;          Undigester uses a stack of Java objects, similar to
          Digester. However, the results of the operation are returned
          directly from the <TT
CLASS="function"
>unparse</TT
> method.

><P
>&#13;                The class of such object is used to find the rules
                that are defined to process it. The searching method
                just compares that the rule's class array corresponds
                with the classes of the objects currently present in
                the stack.

>3.2. Difficulties</H2
><P
>&#13;        The project included <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>JUnit</I
></SPAN
> tests since
        its initial steps, and that turned to be so important that
        otherwise would delay the release of a stable version for
        weeks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The reason is because the core method of the API,
        <TT
CLASS="function"
>Undigester.unparse()</TT
>, was heavily affected every
        time a new feature was implemented, and already existing
        <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>JUnit</I
></SPAN
> tests alerted when latest fixes
        made previous features stopped working.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Besides that, the major milestone was achieved when the
        <TT
CLASS="function"
>GetNextRule</TT
> code was finally working. Such rule
        manages the serialization of iterators and arrays. It
        introduced several important changes to the existing
        algorithm, and therefore the unit tests turned to be extremely
        useful.
