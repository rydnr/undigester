        <strong>Undigester</strong>
         provides a Digester-like way of serializing arbitrary objects
         to XML.

          <b>Undigester</b> has been completely redesigned from
          scratch, to improve and clean its behaviour and maintenance.
          Current
          version, <i>0.6b3</i>, is the result of a major refactoring
          at design level of the 0.4 series.
